<h3>Spirited Away (2003)</h3>
<p>This film explores identity all the while showing that there is good in everyone. Plus the visuals & music are gorgeous!</p>

<h3>Shin Gojira (2016)</h3>
<p>I've loved Godzilla since I was a child & this is easily my favorite because it is both a political drama alongside an absolutely horrendous, yet beautiful (like nature), kaiju/monster film.</p>

<img src="../assets/images/AgJFfkbGMYwt8PCOP75S8ReKYQp.jpg" alt="Pride" style="width: 150px; margin-top: 25px;">
<h3>Pride & Prejudice (2005)</h3>
<p>Love story that is intellegent, funny, & realistic with flawed individuals that learn to love by seeing past their own vices. Plus amazing soundtrack & cinematography!</p>

<img src="../assets/images/Secret.jpg" alt="Walter" style="width: 100px; margin-top: 25px;">
<h3>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (2013)</h3>
<p>A film of self discovery & courage to be more than you are & becoming who you can be. Great cast, funny, visually stunning, & amazing soundtrack!</p>
